## Notes

### The method

For this application we'll go with a lean aproach, where Version 1 will be a Minimun Viable Product and each iteration will add further features or strech goals:
v1 - MVP: Test, Model, Auth, API routes.
v2 - UI: Simple UI, unstilled. StimulusJS.
v3 - Style: We'll add style to our mostly unstilled app.
v4 - Oauth: Add 1 Oauth
v5 - Add more Oath.

### The tools.

We'll try to avoid fishing with dynamite, and use ligthweight tools:
-Back end will run on sinatra with a minimun implementation of ActiveRecord
-Authentication will relly on Bcrypt and JWT.
-FrontEnd will run on StimulusJS to enhance HTML and SCSS
