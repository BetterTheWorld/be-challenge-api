# Challenge

## Notes

### The method

For this application we'll go with a lean approach, where Version 1 will be a Minimum Viable Product and each iteration will add further features or stretch goals:
v1 - MVP: Test, Model, Auth, API routes.
v2 - UI: Simple UI, un-styled. StimulusJS.
v3 - Style: We'll add style to our mostly un-styled app.
v4 - OAuth: Add 1 OAuth
v5 - Add more OAth.
